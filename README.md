Hi there, 

If you're viewing this, you're probably shopping around my portfolio. Maybe you're my future boss. Maybe you're a recruiter. Maybe you're a future client. Or maybe you're just a curious person. 

Whatever the case, it's lovely to meet you. 

## What is this?

Being a Data Journalist is part writer, part data visualiser, and part data-jack-of-all-trades. As part of my D3.JS skill journey, I've been learning the [fundamentals of JavaScript at Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/introduction-to-javascript)

(I already have a few [D3 projects](https://theheasman.com/how-i-used-a-market-basket-analysis-to-get-a-job-offer/) [under my belt](https://theheasman.com/data-history-of-uk-interest-rates/), and can hack my way through JavaScript, but I wanted to get the fundamentals down.)

This project was part of the JavaScript functions module and is intended to introduce the syntax of functions.

## What did you learn?

_I already know the concept of functions from Python..._

* The syntax of functions.
* The syntax of other functions: function expressions, arrow notation, concise body arrow functions.
* Helper functions.


## Where can I view the code?

**[You can see my code solution here.](https://github.com/david-heasman00/javascript-sleep-debt-calculator/blob/main/main.js)**

## How can I speak to you?

Want to chat about a project, or a potential opportunity? I'm happy to connect [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidheasman/). Include a brief note in your connection request about why you're reaching out. 

Till later.
